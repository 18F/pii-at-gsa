# PII Inventory Dashboard


### 

## Description

This dashboard presents information about personally identifiable information (PII) that is collected by our partner's GSA systems. The data was scraped from privacy documents published by GSA.

Privacy offices are burdened with managing compliance paperwork, which reduces their bandwidth for proactive efforts to protect the public’s privacy. This searchable PII inventory was created by a team at 18F to give privacy offices some time back. Here are some activities that this inventory would speed up:

 - finding information about PII from PIAs and SORNs
 - understanding the landscape of PII that you manage
 - producing an inventory as per OMB Circular A-130 requirements
 - improving PII collection practices by system owners
 - minimize PII collection to only that which is legally authorized/mission-essential 
 
Our tool processes GSA’s collection of PIA and SORN documents (PDF and XML) and creates an organized and searchable list of systems and the PII they collect.
 
This PII inventory is a collaboration between 18F and GSA’s Privacy Office. It received funding by GSA’s 10x program. 

We envision a future in which the public can easily understand how and why personally identifiable information gets collected by government agencies. We also envision a future in which the US public can trust the government to keep their personal data safe. We see this PII Inventory Dashboard as a foundational step in this direction.
 
If you are interested in using our tool to create a PII inventory for your agency please reach out to us at privacy_devops@gsa.gov or on Github. We are happy to advise you on how to fork the repository if your team needs help. If you don’t have in-house capacity, 18F is a digital consultancy and we’re also available to work with you implement a PII inventory for your agency.
