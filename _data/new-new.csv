System for Award Management (SAM).,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2013/02/19/2013-03743/privacy-act-of-1974-notice-of-new-system-of-records,"Since SAM combined several Governmentwide systems, it has multiple functional areas. In the Entity Management functional area, SAM contains records that capture information users voluntarily provide about their entity as part of the process to register to do business with the Federal Government, including the entity legal business name, entity email address, entity telephone number, entity Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and entity address. In the case of a sole proprietor, tax laws allow them to use their Social Security Number (SSN) as their TIN if they do not have a separate Employer Identification Number (EIN). The TIN (whether it be an EIN or an SSN) is not publicly available data. In the exclusion portion of the Performance Information functional area, SAM contains records entered by Federal agency suspension and debarment officials, some of which may be records on individuals. Exclusion records on individuals contain certain information that will never be displayed publicly, e.g. street address information, as well as the SSN or TIN. Agencies disclose the SSN of an individual to verify the identity of an individual, only if permitted under the Privacy Act of 1974 and, if appropriate, the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988, as codified in 5 U.S.C. 552(a).","GSA proposes to establish a new system of records subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 (as amended), 5 U.S.C. 552a. The System for Award Management (SAM) consolidates functions that were previously handled by the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system, Excluded Parties List System (EPLS), and Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). SAM provides the capability to manage information about entities wishing to do business with the Federal Government, and maintain information about those entities to ensure that entities seeking to do business with the Federal Government have not been debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded from doing business. SAM maintains this Governmentwide system of records to enable Federal agencies to determine who is registered to do business with the Federal Government, and to identify individuals who have been excluded from participating in Federal procurement and non-procurement (financial or non-financial assistance and benefits programs), throughout the Federal Government. In some instances a record may demonstrate that an exclusion applies only to the agency taking the action, and therefore does not have Governmentwide effect. The purpose of these exclusions is to protect the Government from non-responsible contractors and individuals, ensure proper management throughout the Federal government, and protect the integrity of Federal activities.","System records are retained and disposed of according to GSA records maintenance and disposition schedules, the requirements of the Recovery Board, and the National Archives and Records Administration. For the Entity Management functional area, SAM allows users to update and delete their own entity registration records. For the exclusions portion of the Performance Information functional area, electronic records of past exclusions are maintained permanently in the archive list for historical reference. Federal agencies reporting exclusion information in SAM should follow their agency's guidance and policies for disposition of paper records.",,
