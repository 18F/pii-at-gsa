These records are only used for a brief period of time while the personal identifiers are replaced with unique non-identifying codes. In a controlled Information Technology (IT) environment, the identifying information (SSN) contained in source files is removed and replaced with unique non-identifying codes. The Census Bureau does not collect SSNs in Title 13 surveys or censuses. Title 13, Section 6, authorizes the Census Bureau to acquire information from other federal departments and agencies and for the acquisition of reports of other governmental or private sources. Data acquired by the Census Bureau to meet this directive may include direct identifiers such as name, address, date of birth, driver's license number, and SSN. The direct identifiers are used to identify duplicate lists and link across multiple sources."", ""• The Census Bureau has developed software to standardize and validate incoming person records to assign a unique Census Bureau linkage identifier. This identifier, called the Protected Identification Key (PIK), is retained on files so that SSNs can be removed. This process occurs through the Person Identification Validation System (PVS). The PVS software processes direct identifiers from input files. Census Bureau staff use the person linkage keys to merge files when conducting approved research and operations activities. The software is also used to facilitate record linkage for Census Bureau research partners within the Federal Statistical System. Through legal agreements, linkage keys may be created by the Census Bureau for other Federal Statistical Agencies to produce statistics. The PVS system does not append additional identifying information, only a unique identifier to facilitate record linkage."", ""• The second category contains records that are maintained on unique data sets that are extracted or combined on an as-needed basis in approved projects. Records are extracted or combined as needed using the unique non-identifying codes, not by name or SSN, to prepare numerous statistical products. These records may contain information such as: Demographic information—date of birth, sex, race, ethnicity, household and family characteristics, education, marital status, tribal affiliation, and veteran's status, etc.; Geographical information—address and geographic codes, etc.; Mortality information—cause of death and hospitalization information; Health information—type of provider, services provided, cost of services, and quality indicators, etc.; Economic information—housing characteristics, income, occupation, employment and unemployment information, health insurance coverage, Federal and State program participation, assets, and wealth."", ""• The third category contains two types of records that use name data for specific research activities. The Census Bureau has policies and procedures to review and control name data from administrative records providers and third party sources. This category refers to name data used to plan contact operations for surveys and censuses and for research on names. The first type of records includes Respondent contact information—name (or username), address, telephone number (both landline and cell phone number), and email address or equivalent. The second type of records includes name data used to set Demographic Characteristics Flags—names are compared to lookup tables and used in models to assign sex and ethnicity.
