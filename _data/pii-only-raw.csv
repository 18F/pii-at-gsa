This Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is generally the most sensitive information included in the system. Other information includes payroll, accounting, pay and leave entitlement records, payroll deduction and withholding, and time and attendance records.

There are four tiers of users, as categorized by PII access. “Tier one” users are employees that can access their own personal data only, for example personal contact information, benefit election information and time and attendance records. Examples of “tier two” users are an employee’s supervisor who has access to information including that employee’s home address, personal contact information, and time and attendance records but specifically excluding Social Security Number (SSN) and date of birth (DOB). “Tier three” users are comprised of a subset of GSA OHRM staff users who may have a need to access employees’ SSNs or DOBs, as well as the information available at tiers one and two. “Tier four” users are a different subset of GSA OHRM staff who may need access to voluntarily reported employee data including race and national origin to evaluate how GSA is meeting its policies and practices on hiring and retaining minorities, women, and disabled persons, analyzing their status in the workforce; and for establishing workforce diversity goals and timetables.

HR Links receives information about GSA employees from the systems listed below:
Payroll, Accounting and Reporting (PAR) system –PAR is GSA’s payroll processing system and the link between the GSA’s HR and accounting systems.

However, HR Links and PAR do not exchange employee home addresses, or phone numbers.

GSA JOBS - GSA JOBS contains information on GSA positions. HR Links has a bidirectional connection to GSA JOBS to track which positions are open or being filled.

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Federal Occupational Health (FOH) – HHS’ FOH provides a benefit to all federal agencies for work-life balance activities for Federal employees (https://www.worklife4you.com/index.html) . This FOH-managed program requires that each Federal agency provide a list of current employees to the WorkLife4You vendor. HR Links provides a full list of GSA employees to FOH on a monthly basis including name, e-mail address, birth date, gender, and home address to allow FOH to offer benefits.

OPM’s Electronic Official Personnel Folder (eOPF) – HR Links transmits GSA employees’ personnel records (e.g. promotions, raises, etc.) to OPM’s Enterprise Human Resources Integration (EHRI) initiative to improve the Federal Government’s human capital management. eOPF is each employee’s electronic Official Personnel File. eOPF requires the employee’s name and SSN to validate records.

Enterprise Human Resources Integration (eHRI) – EHRI is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the electronic Official Personnel Folder (eOPF), which protects information rights, benefits, and entitlements of federal employees. Through on-demand Web-based access to personnel folders, EHRI eOPF enables 24/7 concurrent access to personnel information by Human Resources (HR) staff, and employees. It also allows the electronic transfer of the eOPF from one agency to another when the employee moves from one organization to another.
