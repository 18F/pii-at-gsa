  <td>GSA has developed login.gov as a single sign-on identity platform for members of the public to access government services online that require user authentication.4 login.gov is a shared service that federal agencies can use and integrate with online applications; however, agencies are not required to use login.gov. login.gov manages user authentication by allowing users to sign in with an email address, password, multi-factor method, and “identity proofing” by verifying an individual&#39;s asserted identity on behalf of partner agencies. User authentication is the process of establishing confidence in user identities electronically presented to an information system. Identity proofing is the process of verifying that a person is who they say they are. PII must be collected from a login.gov user to identity proof that user at an Identity Assurance Level (IAL) required by a partner agency to grant access to its information, applications, programs, or records (for the purpose of this PIA, ‘‘services&#39;&#39;). The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines IAL as “a category that conveys the degree of confidence that the applicant’s claimed identity is their real identity.”15</td>
  <td>System records will be disposed of in accordance with NARA’s General Records Schedule (GRS) Transmittal 29, section 3.2 “System access records,” which covers user profiles, log-in files, password files, audit trail files and extracts, system usage files, and cost-back files used to assess charges to partner agencies for usage of login.gov.</td>
