          <p> Privacy offices are burdened with managing compliance paperwork, which reduces their bandwidth for proactive efforts to protect the public’s privacy. This searchable Personally Identifiable Information (PII) inventory was created by a team at 18F to give privacy offices some time back. Here are some activities that this inventory would speed up:
            <ul>
              <li> finding information about PII from PIAs and SORNs</li>
              <li> understanding the landscape of PII that you manage</li>
              <li> producing an inventory as per OMB Circular A-130 requirements </li>
              <li> improving PII collection practices by system owners</li>
              <li> minimize PII collection to only that which is legally authorized/mission-essential</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Our tool processes GSA’s collection of PIA and SORN documents (PDF and XML) and creates an organized and searchable list of systems and the PII they collect.</p>

          <p>This PII inventory is a collaboration between 18F and GSA’s Privacy Office. It received funding by GSA’s 10x program.</p>

          <p>If you are interested in using our tool to create a PII inventory for your agency please reach out to us at <a class="usa-link" href="mailto:privacy_devops@gsa.gov">privacy_devops@gsa.gov</a> or on <a class="usa-link" href="https://github.com/18F/privacy-dashboard">Github.</a> We are happy to advise you on how to fork the repository if your team needs help. If you don’t have in-house capacity, 18F is a digital consultancy and we’re also available to work with you implement a PII inventory for your agency.
